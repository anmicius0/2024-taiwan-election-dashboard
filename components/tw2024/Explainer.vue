      "The candidates for the 2024 Taiwan Presidential Election have different approaches to cross-Strait relations. Lai Ching-te takes a cautious stance on Taiwan's independence and wants to diversify the island's economic relationships. Hou You-yi's stance is less clear, but he has shown signs of straying from Tsai's energy policy. Ko Wen-je attempts to position himself as a neutral third option, aligning more with the pan-Blue camp and showing potential to tilt Taiwan economically and politically toward the mainland. Terry Gou's stance is unclear, but his campaign has been marked by numerous scandals. Their platforms and positions on cross-Strait relations could shape Taiwan's role in the international community and its relations with China and other countries.",
